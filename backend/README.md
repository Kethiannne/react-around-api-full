# Around the U.S. Front End + Back End

## Directories

`/public` — static files from the build of the React front-end app.

`/data` — JSON files to temporarily emulate database integration.

`/routes` — routing files.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server.

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature.

## Nate Notes

eslint seems to be behaving differently with me than with the other students i've asked for help.
Some of its formatting suggestions are really helpful, some really confuse me.
i learned a lot in putting this project together, about node, and about servers in general.
